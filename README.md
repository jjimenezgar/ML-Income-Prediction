# :dollar: Machine Learning models to predict incomes 	

Knowing with great precision whether annual income of an adult in the US could be greater than $50,000 a year may be possible using machine learning classification models. In this paper we use classification models on a data set obtained from the census of adult income in the US The objective of our study is to know precisely if someone is earning more or less than $50,000 annually.

The following models are used:

* Decision tree
* random forest
* K-nearest neighbors

The metrics of these classification models were compared in order to find the model with the highest accuracy.
